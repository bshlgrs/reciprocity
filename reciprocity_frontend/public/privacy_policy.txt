## Privacy policy

When you log into reciprocity.io or interact with the app you should assume
that we store everything you do. We also use the facebook API to get your
photo and list of friends who use reciprocity.  The data is
used to implement the app and to calculate anonymized statistics like total number
of users and total number of matches.  If you destroy your account we will try
to immediately remove all of the interesting data about you, but we won't be
able to remove you from all of the log files etc.; for all we know that stuff
will stick around indefinitely.

All of that data is stored unencrypted in our database, so we could look at it
if we wanted to. We promise not to.  We try to be basically sensible about security,
but probably a sufficiently determined attacker could somehow get the data.

We use cookies to keep track of the fact that you are logged in.
