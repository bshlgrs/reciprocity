## Privacy policy

We use the facebook API to get your
photo and list of friends who use reciprocity.  The data is
used to implement the app and to calculate anonymized statistics like total number
of users and total number of matches.

The only data that we process is your username, list of friends, bio, and the checks you click. We process this data
for the purpose of implementing the app.

We use cookies to keep track of the fact that you are logged in.

If you use the "redesign this website" feature, your queries might be viewed by the developer, to prevent abuse and for our amusement.
